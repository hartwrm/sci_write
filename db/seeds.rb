# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# Prompt.create([{writing_prompt: "It’s not really a fly. If you swat it, they’ll just fine you and send two more."}, {writing_prompt: "We’re headed to Madam Maxime’s at the edge of the universe."}, {writing_prompt: "Why grieve when you can keep your loved one encased in Forever Glass™?"}, {writing_prompt: "A group of intelligence-enhanced lab animals must find a way to communicate before their turn in the euthanization chamber."}])
